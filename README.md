# NixOS config

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is an entirely declarative package manager and Linux distribution. It's config is all in one place and for me... That one place is here!

## Features

- [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) desktop (configured in [home-manager](https://github.com/zax71/NixOS/tree/main/home-manager/programs/awesome))
- Stylized terminal with Zsh, [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) and a [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal
- Clean looking application switcher in [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)

- [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/zax71/NixOS/tree/main/home-manager/programs/neovim) that was heavily inspired by [Kidsan](https://github.com/Kidsan/nixos-config/tree/main/home/programs/neovim)
